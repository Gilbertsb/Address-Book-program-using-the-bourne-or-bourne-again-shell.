It is menu-based, allowing you the options of:  Search address book Add entries Remove / edit entries You will also need a "display" function to display a record or records when  selected.




How this program work
---------------------------
Run the program this way : ./projectsum.sh

The program has a Menu like this

=========================
 1. Add Entries    
 2. Display all Records      
 3. Search Address Book   
 4. Edit Entries         
 5. Remove Entries       
=========================


Search: When the user searches for "Harry", the script should identify and display all "Harry" records. 
It is up to you whether this search is in Surname only, or in the entire record.

Add: Input the data (Name, Surname, Email, Phone, etc). If it appears to be a duplicate, edit the existing 
record. Save the record into the data file when the user confirms.

Remove: Enter search criteria, narrow it down to one, confirm, then remove that record.

Edit: As remove, but use the existing record for default entries. For example, if you change the phone number,
the session may look like this, if you only want to change Harry Porterâ€™s Phone Number:


To choose any option you have to enter a number assigned to it.

NB:

You have to keep in mind that when you enter a surname the program will not handel  capital letter or small letter, 
so write the surname as it is. If it's capital write in capital and if it's small letter write it in a small letter

The program will not execute the instruction you asked well if you enter another detail instead of surname, so the 
only thing to use is Surname for better execution when prompted.

After every instruction is excuted the program will prompt you to go back to Menu by choosing "Y" and to exit the 
program by choosing "N"


After choosing any option from Menu just follow instructions it's easy.

Enjoy!!!!
